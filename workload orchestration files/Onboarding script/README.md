# Onboarding Script

## Pre-requisites

- Run `winget install -e --id Microsoft.AzureCLI` and `winget install -e --id Kubernetes.kubectl`
- Download the config-manager CLI extension WHL from [here](https://microsoftapc-my.sharepoint.com/personal/audapure_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Faudapure%5Fmicrosoft%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FBugBash%2FWHL&ga=1).
- Download JSON files for schemas, configs from [here](https://microsoftapc-my.sharepoint.com/personal/audapure_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Faudapure%5Fmicrosoft%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FBugBash&ga=1).
- Edit the `onboarding-data.json` file. You can find mock data in `mock-data.json`. Instructions about various properties are provided below.

## Common Data Section in input JSON

This is used by both scripts below. It is optional if you choose to add these fields in the `cmOnboarding` or `infraOnboarding` section.

- `subscriptionId [Optional]` : When using common subId, do not override this field in the `cmOnboarding` or `infraOnboarding` section.
- `resourceGroup [Optional]` : When using common RG, do not override this field in the `cmOnboarding` or `infraOnboarding` section.
- `location [Optional]`: When using common location, do not override this field in the `cmOnboarding` or `infraOnboarding` section.
- `customLocationFile [DO NOT MODIFY]`: This is automatically added by the onboarding script, do not modify it when running the cm onboarding script.

## 1. Infra Onboarding

The infra setup script helps you onboard to the infrastructure needed for config manager, such as creating an AKS cluster, deploying TCO on the cluster, creating Custom Location & Site, and finally installing the config-manager CLI extension.

‚ùó **IMPORTANT:** The Service Group name should be unique across tenants. So the site name input must be chosen carefully.

Command: `infra_onboarding.ps1 mock-data.json`
Arguments: (all of them are boolean arguments which take `$true`/`$false` as values.)

- `-skipResourceGroupCreation` (default `$false`): Skip creation of resource group
- `-skipAzLogin` (default `$true`): Skip az login.
- `-skipAzExtensions` (default `$false`): Skip installing/updating connectedk8s, k8s-extension & customlocation extensions.
- `-skipAksCreation` (default `$false`): Skip creation of AKS cluster, use when the cluster is already created.
- `-skipTcoDeployment` (default `$false`): Skip connecting AKS to Arc and creation of TCO extension, use when TCO has been deployed already.
- `-skipCustomLocationCreation` (default `$false`): Skip creation of CustomLocation, use when it has been created before.
- `-skipConnectedRegistryDeployment` (default `$true`): Skip connected registry deployment. By default, this step is skipped. Set to false when user need to deploy the connected registry on AKS cluster for staging. 
- `-skipSiteCreation` (default `$false`): Skip creation of Site and SiteAddress, use when it has been created before.
- `-skipAutoParsing` (default `$false`): Skip auto-creation of custom location file and auto-parsing of site file. By default, user does not need to set the "addressResourceId" field in the site file and does not need to pass a customLocationFile in the target data section. Set this to `$true` if you want to assign your own custom location (not created via onboarding script) or your own site address (not created via onboarding script)
- `-enableWODiagnostics` (default `$false`): Enable workload orchestration extension user-facing logs, use when users want to collect workload orchestration extension user audits and user diagnostics logs.
- `-enableContainerInsights` (default `$false`): Enable Container.Insights on arc cluster to collect container logs and k8s events, use when users want to collect container logs or k8s events.

## Prerequsite Context Creation Script (If not using an existing Context)

```powershell

# Context is Created 1 per Tenant today.
az workload-orchestration context create `
 --resource-group <Context-ResourceGroup> `
 --location <Location> `
 --name <ContextName> `
 --capabilities [0].name="$resourcePrefix-soap2" [0].description="$resourcePrefix-Soap2" [1].name="$resourcePrefix-shampoo2" [1].description="$resourcePrefix-Shampoo2" `
 --hierarchies [0].name=factory [0].description=Factory [1].name=line [1].description=Line

```
Please add the required data in onboarding-data.json after you create the context

```json
        "contextResourceGroup": "",
        "contextName": "",
        "contextSubscriptionId": "",
        "contextLocation": "",  
```

# Known Issues

## Custom Location Creation Error with Azure CLI 2.70.0

When running the infrastructure onboarding script, you may encounter the following error during custom location creation:

```
'CredentialAdaptor' object has no attribute 'signed_session'

```

This issue specifically affects Azure CLI version 2.70.0 and occurs when using the `az customlocation create` command.

### Workaround

####  Create the Custom Location via Azure Portal

1. Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Click "+ Create a resource" and search for "custom location"
3. In the "Basics" tab:
   - Select your subscription and resource group
   - Enter a name for your custom location
   - Select your Arc-enabled cluster
   - Select the appropriate extension (either `microsoft.testsymphonyex` or `microsoft.workloadorchestreation`)
   - Specify your namespace (the same value you'd use in the script)
4. Complete the creation process

After creating the custom location through the portal, run the script with `-skipCustomLocationCreation $true` to skip this step.

#### Additional Script Parameters

The infrastructure script supports skipping various components if they've already been created or if you're troubleshooting specific parts:

```powershell
.\infra_onboarding.ps1 -onboardingFile "your-file.json" `
    -skipAzExtensions $true `         # Skip Azure CLI extensions installation/update
    -skipResourceGroupCreation $true ` # Skip resource group creation
    -skipAksCreation $true `          # Skip AKS cluster creation
    -skipTcoDeployment $true `        # Skip TCO deployment on AKS
    -skipCustomLocationCreation $true ` # Skip custom location creation
         # Skip Edge site creation
```

Use these parameters as needed based on which components you've already created or want to skip.
